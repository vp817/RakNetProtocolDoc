### RakNet Protocol Packet Send and Receive Sequence

#### Server

1. Wait for an UnconnectedPing packet from a client.
   - This is a request from the client to check if the server is available and responding.
   - Respond with an UnconnectedPong packet to let the client know that the server is available.
   
2. Wait for an OpenConnectionRequestOne packet from a client.
   - This is the first part of a handshake protocol to initiate a connection request with the server.
   - If the protocol version is correct, respond with an OpenConnectionReplyOne packet to acknowledge the connection request.
   - If the protocol version is incorrect, respond with an IncompatibleProtocolVersion packet to inform the client that the connection request is rejected.
   
3. Wait for an OpenConnectionRequestTwo packet from the client.
   - This is the second part of the handshake protocol to establish a connection with the server.
   - Respond with an OpenConnectionReplyTwo packet to let the client know that the connection is established.

### UnconnectedPing

This packet is used to determine if a server is online or not. It also include information about open connections.

| Field | Type | Endianness | Note |
| ----- | ---- | ----------| ----- |
| onlyReplyOnOpenConnections | bool | N/A | If set to true, the server will only send a reply if the client's connection to the server is currently open. This helps to prevent sending responses to clients that have closed their connections. This is especially useful in peer-to-peer networks where clients may come and go frequently. By setting this field to true, the client can avoid wasting network resources by only sending requests when it knows that the server will be able to respond. The resulting message ID for the request would be `UnconnectedPingOpenConnections`. If set to false, the default behavior is `UnconnectedPing`. |

| UnreliableSequenced      | 1   | No          | Yes        | Yes          |
| Reliable                 | 2   | Yes         | No         | No           |
| ReliableArranged         | 3   | Yes         | Yes        | No           |
| ReliableSequenced        | 4   | Yes         | Yes        | Yes          |

* **Unreliable:** This Reliability TypeID sends datagrams without any guarantees that they will arrive at the destination. They are not guaranteed to be delivered in any specific order or at all.

* **UnreliableSequenced:** This Reliability TypeID sends datagrams without any guarantees that they will arrive at the destination but ensures that they are delivered in the sequence they were sent.

* **Reliable:** This Reliability TypeID sends datagrams guaranteed to be delivered in the order they were sent. If a datagram is lost, RakNet will retransmit it until it is acknowledged by the receiver.

* **ReliableArranged:** This Reliability TypeID sends datagrams guaranteed to be delivered in the order they were sent. If a datagram is lost, RakNet will not retransmit it and all datagrams before it that have not been acknowledged. 

* **ReliableSequenced:** This Reliability TypeID sends datagrams guaranteed to be delivered in the order they were sent and ensures that they are delivered sequentially.

* **UnreliableWithAckReceipt:** This Reliability TypeID sends datagrams without any guarantees that they will arrive at the destination, but the receiver sends an acknowledgement receipt upon receipt of this datagram.

* **ReliableWithAckReceipt:** This Reliability TypeID sends datagrams guaranteed to be delivered in the order they were sent, and the receiver sends an acknowledgement receipt upon receipt of this datagram.

* **ReliableArrangedWithAckReceipt:** This Reliability TypeID sends datagrams guaranteed to be delivered in the order they were sent but all datagrams before it that have not been acknowledged, and the receiver sends an acknowledgement receipt upon receipt of this datagram.

### Reliability definitions
Here you can find every reliability definition which is used in other places at the documentation.

1. Reliable - This is when the reliability is of any type that is reliable
2. Sequenced - This is when the reliability is both unreliable sequenced and reliable sequenced
3. Sequenced and arranged - This is when the reliability is `Sequenced` and reliable arranged and reliable arranged with ack recepit

### Retransmission
RakNet uses selective repeat retransmission to ensure reliable delivery of datagrams. When a datagram is sent, it is assigned a sequence number. If a datagram is not acknowledged within a certain timeout period, RakNet will retransmit the datagram using the same sequence number. When the receiver receives a duplicate datagram with the same sequence number, it can discard it, since it has already acknowledged that sequence number.

### AckQueue / NackQueue
The AckQueue and NackQueue are used to keep track of which datagrams have been acknowledged and which have not. The AckQueue stores a list of datagram sequence numbers that have been successfully acknowledged, while the NackQueue stores a list of datagram sequence numbers that have not been acknowledged and need to be retransmitted. When a datagram is received with a sequence number that has already been acknowledged, it can be discarded.

### PacketPair
PacketPair is a technique used by RakNet to improve the efficiency of datagram retransmissions. When a datagram is acknowledged, RakNet sends the next datagram in the sequence as well. This allows the receiver to begin processing the next datagram immediately, reducing latency and improving throughput.

### ContinuousSend
ContinuousSend is a feature of RakNet that allows datagrams to be sent continuously without waiting for acknowledgement. This can improve performance in some cases, but can also lead to packet loss and retransmissions, since the sender does not wait for feedback before sending the next datagram.

### Reassembly
RakNet uses a reassembly mechanism to reconstruct segmented datagrams that may be received out of order. When a datagram is segmented, each segment is assigned a unique identifier. When the receiver receives a segment, it is buffered until all segments with the same identifier have been received. Once all segments have been received, they are reassembled into the original datagram.

### Flow Control
Flow Control is a RakNet mechanism used to manage the rate of data transmission between sender and receiver. It ensures that the receiver can handle the incoming data at a pace it can process, preventing overwhelming or overflowing the receiver's buffer. Flow control helps maintain a balance between the sender's transmission speed and the receiver's processing capability, optimizing the overall efficiency and stability of the communication.

### Congestion Control
Congestion control is a RakNet technique used to prevent network congestion by balancing data transmission rates. Techniques like TCP congestion control, packet dropping, rate limiting, traffic shaping, QoS, and load balancing are used. These techniques ensure reliable data delivery and efficient transmission in RakNet.

### Segment
Segmentation in RakNet enhances data delivery by dividing large messages into smaller segments. These segments, with headers indicating position and size, ensure successful reassembly on the receiver's end. By comparing the buffer size to the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size (usually 1400), if the buffer exceeds the MTU, it is split into segments for transmission. This mechanism in RakNet prevents data loss, manages large payloads, and guarantees reliable transmission in networked applications.

### B
"B" represents the link capacity or the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted per second over the network link. The link capacity is determined by multiple factors, including the network infrastructure, the network configuration, and the available resources. By using a float value, the network capacity can be represented more accurately and precisely, enabling better utilization of the available resources.

### AS
"AS" represents the data arrival rate, which is the rate at which the data is generated and sent by the sender. The use of a float value allows for more precise representation of the arrival rate, which can vary based on the application requirements and the network conditions. By comparing the arrival rate with the link capacity, the sender can determine the amount of data that can be sent over the network link without causing congestion or degradation of performance.

### CapsuleLayer Size
To determine the size of the capsule layer, you can follow these steps:
1. Increment the byte by 1 step to represent the reliability.
2. Increment the byte by 2 steps to accommodate the size of the buffer.
3. If the reliability is any type of reliable, increment the byte by 3 steps to represent the `reliableCapsuleIndex`.
4. If the reliability is sequenced, increment the byte by 3 steps to represent the `sequencedCapsuleIndex`.
5. If the reliability is sequenced and arranged increment the byte by 3 steps for the `arrangedCapsuleIndex`, and then by 1 step for the `arrangementChannel`.
6. If the capsule is segmented, increment the byte by 4 steps for the `size`, 2 steps for the `id`, and 4 steps for the `index` of the segment.

### UserPacketEnum
The UserPacketEnum ID is `0x86`, which marks the beginning of where you can start using your custom packet IDs.

### Sending a Non-RakNet Packet
To send a non-RakNet packet, first determine if segmentation is needed by comparing the buffer size to the MTU size minus 2, plus 3, plus 4 times 1 (for the datagram's data header byte length), and subtracting 11 if security is in use. Then, subtract the given value with the capsule size. If segmentation is necessary, reassemble the packet before adding it to the datagram queue for transmission. If no segmentation is required, add it directly to the queue. Remember, segmented packets must not be unreliable; if they are, convert them to reliable packets to guarantee successful and ordered delivery of all packet parts.
