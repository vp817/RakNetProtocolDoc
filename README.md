# RakNet Protocol Documentation

This is the latest RakNet protocol documentation. It includes information on the data types used in the protocol and details about each packet and their associated fields.

TODO: modify to make it better for the eye and remove a lot of useless stuff.
And also organize things, such as enums/constants in 1 place, and also remove repeated things.

This documentation assumes you want similar/same security method of libcat, that's why if the server/client you're targeting doesn't have libcat or whatever same as that but they also have security enabled, the client will crash because they will only give you a cookie, no identity proof or anything of the likes. but you can pull request for supporting both cases or you can wait until this is rewritten.

### RakNet Protocol Packet Send and Receive Sequence

#### Server

1. Wait for an UnconnectedPing packet from a client.
   - This is a request from the client to check if the server is available and responding.
   - Respond with an UnconnectedPong packet to let the client know that the server is available.
   
2. Wait for an OpenConnectionRequestOne packet from a client.
   - This is the first part of a handshake protocol to initiate a connection request with the server.
   - If the protocol version is correct, respond with an OpenConnectionReplyOne packet to acknowledge the connection request.
   - If the protocol version is incorrect, respond with an IncompatibleProtocolVersion packet to inform the client that the connection request is rejected.
   
3. Wait for an OpenConnectionRequestTwo packet from the client.
   - This is the second part of the handshake protocol to establish a connection with the server.
   - Respond with an OpenConnectionReplyTwo packet to let the client know that the connection is established.
   - Create a new connection for the client and save its connection information to handle future online packets.
   
4. Wait for datagrams from the client.
   - Handle the datagrams received from the client as required, whether they are AckedDatagrams, NackedDatagrams, require B and AS values, or are segmented packets.
   - After that you will receive inside the datagram received a list of packets that will be sent seperately down you will see them and understand
		- Wait for an ConnectionRequest packet from the client
			- Respond with an ConnectionRequestAccepted that is reliable.
		- Wait for an NewIncomingConneciton packet
			- Check if the server port is the same as the address of the client inside NewIncomingConnection then mark it as connected if so.
			- Response with a ConnectedPong packet that is unreliable.
		- Wait for a DisconnectNotification
			- Handle it as you want.
		- Wait for a ConnectedPing
			- Response with a ConnectedPong that is unreliable.

#### Client

1. Send an UnconnectedPing packet to the server.
   - This is a request to check if the server is available and responding.
   - Wait for an UnconnectedPong packet from the server to confirm that the server is available.

2. Send an OpenConnectionRequestOne packet to the server.
   - This is the first part of a handshake protocol to initiate a connection request with the server.
   - Wait for an OpenConnectionReplyOne packet from the server to acknowledge the connection request.
   - If an IncompatibleProtocolVersion packet is received instead of an OpenConnectionReplyOne packet, the connection request is rejected.

3. Send an OpenConnectionRequestTwo packet to the server.
   - This is the second part of the handshake protocol to establish a connection with the server.
   - Wait for an OpenConnectionReplyTwo packet from the server to confirm that the connection is established.
   - If the connection request is rejected, the client should start again from step 1.

4. Send datagrams to the server.
   - Handle the datagrams sent to the client, whether they are AckedDatagrams, NackedDatagrams, require B and AS values, or are segmented packets.
   - But before handling, at when you handle the OpenConnectionReplyTwo or anywhere related such as if the OpenConnectionReplyTwo got received, you need to do the following after you do what you want:
		- Send a ConnectionRequest packet to the server.
			- Wait for a ConnectionRequestAccepted packet from the server.
		- Send a NewIncomingConnection packet to the server.
			- Send a ConnectedPing packet that is unreliable.
		- Send a DisconnectNotification packet to the server. (if you want to disconnect)
		- Wait for ConnectedPong.
			- Response with ConnectedPing.

You can write your own way of calculating the connection outcome but this below is the standard way.

**Calculating ConnectionOutcome**:
- Get the client address.
- Use `bitwise and` to check if the checks below is needed using `contains address` and `contains guid` boolean values.
  - If the client is not currently connected or it's address is not found in the list, then the outcome is 1.
  - Otherwise, set it to 2.
- If the `clientGuid` is already associated with a client that has a different client address, set the connection state to 3.
- If the client address is already associated with a different `clientGuid`, set the connection state to 4.
- Otherwise, set the state to 0.

> Once you have calculated the `ConnectionOutcome`, You will need to check if it is equal to 1 then send the `OpenConnectionReplyTwo` packet.

> If the `ConnectionOutcome` is not 0, send the `AlreadyConnected` packet.

> Note: If the identity proof is invalid and `doIdentity` is set to true, immediately send a `RemoteSystemRequiresPublicKey` packet with a type ID of `ClientIdentityIsInvalid`. If `doIdentity` is set to false and there is no identity proof, send a `RemoteSystemRequiresPublicKey` packet with a type ID of `ClientIdentityIsMissing`.

After you send or receive this packet to the server, you need to keep the connection alive by sending periodic `ConnectedPing` packets. These packets are essentially a way to say "hey, I'm still here and connected to the server." The server also sends `ConnectedPong` packets back in response to confirm that the connection is still active. This ping-pong process helps prevent the connection from timing out due to inactivity or network issues.

| min | uint24 | Little Endian | Minimum value in the range|
| max | uint24 | Little Endian | Maximum value in the range - Is not wrote if is single |

### ValidDatagram

This packet is used for sending and receiving data between clients and the server.

| Field | Type | Endianness | Note |
| ----- | ---- | ----------| ----- |
| isPacketPair | bit | N/A | If true, the packet is one of two associated packets |
| isContinuousSend | bit | N/A | If true, the packet is a continuous send packet |
| requiresBAndAS | bit | N/A | If true, the packet includes B and AS values |
| rangeNumber | uint24 | Little Endian | The sequence number of the datagram |
| capsules | DatagramCapsule[] | N/A | Array of capsules in the packet |

**Checking for corrupt arrangment channels**:
(the valid datagram must be `Sequenced And Arranged (No ack receipt))

if `arrangmentChannel` is greater or equals to number of arranged streams available which is 2 ^ 5 then it is correupted(skip and do what is needed).

every valid datagram arrangement type of an array max value is the number of arranged streams and must not be greater or equals to.

**Finding hole count in received datagrams**:
(the valid datagram must be `Reliable or in sequence` before proceeding further)

you will need to check hole count in valid datagrams that is `Reliable or in sequence` and the reason is to check for their order and it serves as a check if there was some kind of missing valid datagram received or wrong `rangeNumber` was used in sending or whatever else reason.

`receivedPacketsBaseIndex`: it only increments if valid datagram `Reliable or in sequence`

`receivedPacketQueue`: it is something that stores the `rangeNumber` of valid datagram as the key in the list and it's value is true not the datagram, it can be false but after meeting some coditions that will be stated below (false means that we got it sucessfully and true means we didn't get it sucessfully) and it it's data structure is a `DS_Queue`(Check original raknet for the impl).

to find the hole count subtract the current received valid datagram's `rangeNumber` with the `receivedPacketsBaseIndex` and that property increments everytime there is no hole count (`receivedPacketsBaseIndex` only increments if `Reliable or in sequence`).

1. if the hole count is 0 then it is a proper valid datagram so you can handle it normally but before that remove it from `receivedPacketQueue` if it exists and add (pre-)increment the `receivedPacketsBaseIndex`.
2. if the hole count is greater than the maximum value of `uint24` that is `bitwise right shifted` by 1 then it is a duplicated packet (skip and do what is needed).
3. if the hole count is smaller than the `receivedPacketQueue` size
	- if the hole count is an index/key of the `receivedPacketQueue` and is not equals to false then fill the hole by replacing the key of the hole count in `receivedPacketQueue` with a key that it's value is equals to false.
	- else it is a duplicate packet (skip and do what is needed).

if these conditions stated up was not met then:

1. if the hole count is greater than 1000000 then the hole count is too high (skip and do what is needed).
2. if hole count(with `bitwise and` the `uint32` max value if needed) is greater than the `receivedPacketQueue` size then fill it by pushing true values in queue.
3. after condition(2) was done then push false to queue.

after that you can create a loop and check if `receivedPacketQueue` size is greater than 0 and first value of `receivedPacketQueue` is false then remove the last element of the `receivedPacketQueue` then increment the `receivedPacketsBaseIndex`.

after that you can handle the valid datagrams normally.

### Reliability definitions

Here you can find every reliability definition which is used in other places at the documentation.

1. Reliable - This is when the reliability is of any type that is reliable
2. Sequenced - This is when the reliability is both unreliable sequenced and reliable sequenced
3. Sequenced and arranged - This is when the reliability is `Sequenced` and reliable arranged and reliable arranged with ack recepit
4. Reliable or in sequence - This is when the reliability is reliable or reliable sequenced or reliable arranged

### Retransmission
RakNet uses selective repeat retransmission to ensure reliable delivery of datagrams. When a datagram is sent, it is assigned a sequence number. If a datagram is not acknowledged within a certain timeout period, RakNet will retransmit the datagram using the same sequence number. When the receiver receives a duplicate datagram with the same sequence number, it can discard it, since it has already acknowledged that sequence number.

### AckQueue / NackQueue
The AckQueue and NackQueue are used to keep track of which datagrams have been acknowledged and which have not. The AckQueue stores a list of datagram sequence numbers that have been successfully acknowledged, while the NackQueue stores a list of datagram sequence numbers that have not been acknowledged and need to be retransmitted. When a datagram is received with a sequence number that has already been acknowledged, it can be discarded.

### PacketPair
PacketPair is a technique used by RakNet to improve the efficiency of datagram retransmissions. When a datagram is acknowledged, RakNet sends the next datagram in the sequence as well. This allows the receiver to begin processing the next datagram immediately, reducing latency and improving throughput.

### ContinuousSend
ContinuousSend is a feature of RakNet that allows datagrams to be sent continuously without waiting for acknowledgement. This can improve performance in some cases, but can also lead to packet loss and retransmissions, since the sender does not wait for feedback before sending the next datagram.

### Reassembly
RakNet uses a reassembly mechanism to reconstruct segmented datagrams that may be received out of order. When a datagram is segmented, each segment is assigned a unique identifier. When the receiver receives a segment, it is buffered until all segments with the same identifier have been received. Once all segments have been received, they are reassembled into the original datagram.

### Flow Control
Flow Control is a RakNet mechanism used to manage the rate of data transmission between sender and receiver. It ensures that the receiver can handle the incoming data at a pace it can process, preventing overwhelming or overflowing the receiver's buffer. Flow control helps maintain a balance between the sender's transmission speed and the receiver's processing capability, optimizing the overall efficiency and stability of the communication.

### Congestion Manager
congestion manager holds congestion control, checking for skipped range numbers to send nacks, and other things.

### Congestion Control
Congestion control is a RakNet technique used to prevent network congestion by balancing data transmission rates. Techniques like TCP congestion control, packet dropping, rate limiting, traffic shaping, QoS, and load balancing are used. These techniques ensure reliable data delivery and efficient transmission in RakNet.

### Segment
Segmentation in RakNet enhances data delivery by dividing large messages into smaller segments. These segments, with headers indicating position and size, ensure successful reassembly on the receiver's end. By comparing the buffer size to the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size, if the buffer exceeds the MTU, it is split into segments for transmission. This mechanism in RakNet prevents data loss, manages large payloads, and guarantees reliable transmission in networked applications.

### B
"B" represents the link capacity or the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted per second over the network link. The link capacity is determined by multiple factors, including the network infrastructure, the network configuration, and the available resources. By using a float value, the network capacity can be represented more accurately and precisely, enabling better utilization of the available resources.

### AS
"AS" represents the data arrival rate, which is the rate at which the data is generated and sent by the sender. The use of a float value allows for more precise representation of the arrival rate, which can vary based on the application requirements and the network conditions. By comparing the arrival rate with the link capacity, the sender can determine the amount of data that can be sent over the network link without causing congestion or degradation of performance.

### Capsule Size
To determine the size of the capsule, you can follow these steps:
1. Increment the byte by 1 step to represent the reliability.
2. Increment the byte by 2 steps to accommodate the size of the buffer.
3. If the reliability is any type of reliable, increment the byte by 3 steps to represent the `reliableCapsuleIndex`.
4. If the reliability is sequenced, increment the byte by 3 steps to represent the `sequencedCapsuleIndex`.
5. If the reliability is sequenced and arranged increment the byte by 3 steps for the `arrangedCapsuleIndex`, and then by 1 step for the `arrangementChannel`.
6. If the capsule is segmented, increment the byte by 4 steps for the `size`, 2 steps for the `id`, and 4 steps for the `index` of the segment.

### UserPacketEnum
The UserPacketEnum ID is `0x86`, which marks the beginning of where you can start using your custom packet IDs.

What is recommended is to create a `PacketAggregator` considering you have a completed implementation then send and receive it.

You can put an id of your choice, like: `UserPacketEnumID` + your own id (it must not make the `UserPacketEnumID` surpass the `uint8 limit`)

For example: `UserPacketEnumID` + 22 = 0x9c

A simple packet structue showcasing what the `PacketAggregator` can be:

| Field | Type | Endianness | Note |
| ----- | ---- | ----------| ----- |
| id | uint8 | N/A | Unique identifier of the packet |
| compressionAlgorithm | uint8 | The compression algorithm [Can be none, openssl, zlib, gzip, snappy, anything] |
| streams | buffer[] | An array of packet streams (Each element in the streams array represents a packet buffer which is encoded/and is to be decoded in the `compressionAlgorithm`) |

After that you will send it in the valid datagram capsule/s buffer

### Sending a Non-RakNet Packet
To send a non-RakNet packet, first determine if segmentation is needed by comparing if the capsule buffer size is greater than the MTU size minus 2, plus 3, plus 4 times 1 (for the datagram's data header byte length), and subtracting 11 if security is in use. Then, subtract the given value with the capsule size. If segmentation is necessary, segemnt the capsule's stream before adding it to the datagram queue for transmission. If no segmentation is required, add it directly to the queue. Remember, segmented packets must not be unreliable; if they are, convert them to reliable packets to guarantee successful and ordered delivery of all packet parts.

The way to segment it into parts:

get the capsule size and also the capsule buffer size then the size that you used to check if is greater than the capsule buffer size and define them.

to get the count of how many segments is needed to be made: subtract the capsule buffer size with 1 then divide it with the size that you used to check if is greater than the capsule buffer size then sum them with 1 (not two times) or you can ceil instead of subtracting 1 and adding 1 at the end

then define a `current segment index` outside the loop and is 0 by default

then do a loop that will use the count of how many segments then the segmentation process will start:

after that define a variable representing `start offset` and it is equals to `current segment index` multiplied by the size that you used to check if is greater than the capsule buffer size

after that define a variable representing `bytes to send` that is equals to capsule buffer size subtracted by `start offset`

check if `bytes to send` is greater than the size that you used to check if is greater than the capsule buffer size and if true set the `bytes to send` value to the size that you used to check...

after that create a new variable representing the `end offset`

check if the `bytes to send` is not the size that you used to check if is greater than the capsule buffer size then set the `end offset` to the capsule buffer size subtracted by the `current segment index` multiplied by the size that you used to check if is greater than the capsule buffer size

if the check fails then the `end offset` will be the `bytes to send`

after that slice the capsule buffer with the `start offset` and `end offset` then you can do the feilds in the capsule.

you will need an array that has the capsules that contains the segments that will then be sent in queue.

the segment id will be the `sender last segment id` property that will increment outside the loop every time.
